# Would_You_Survive_The_Titanic-
i have made an algorithm that will predict whether you wouldve survived the titanic if you were present in that time

This has helped me learn on how to deal with dataframes and how to handle missing data 
I have used the titanic dataset from kaggle 
I have an F1 score of 0.81
